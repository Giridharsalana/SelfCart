Troubleshooting procedures provide systematic approaches to identifying and resolving common issues that may occur during deployment and operation. Comprehensive troubleshooting guides enable rapid issue resolution and minimize service disruption.

### Common Deployment Issues

Common deployment issues include configuration errors, service connectivity problems, and authentication failures. Understanding common issues and their solutions enables rapid problem resolution.

Firebase configuration errors often result from incorrect project settings, missing API keys, or improper service enablement. Verify Firebase project configuration and ensure all required services are enabled with proper quotas.

Mobile app deployment issues frequently involve code signing problems, missing certificates, or app store policy violations. Validate code signing configurations and ensure compliance with app store requirements.

Cloud Functions deployment failures commonly result from dependency issues, timeout configurations, or permission problems. Review function configurations and ensure proper IAM permissions for service access.

Payment gateway integration issues often involve incorrect API credentials, webhook configuration problems, or security validation failures. Verify payment gateway configurations and test with sandbox credentials.

### Performance Troubleshooting

Performance issues can significantly impact user experience and business operations. Systematic performance troubleshooting identifies bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.

Mobile app performance problems often result from inefficient database queries, excessive network requests, or memory leaks. Use performance profiling tools to identify resource usage patterns and optimization opportunities.

Database performance issues frequently involve missing indexes, inefficient queries, or excessive read/write operations. Analyze query performance and implement appropriate indexes and query optimizations.

Cloud Functions performance problems commonly result from cold start delays, inefficient code, or resource constraints. Optimize function code and configure appropriate memory and timeout settings.

Network performance issues often involve slow API responses, large payload sizes, or inefficient caching. Implement caching strategies and optimize data transfer sizes.

### Security Incident Response

Security incidents require immediate attention and systematic response procedures to minimize impact and prevent further compromise. Proper incident response protects customer data and maintains system integrity.

Authentication failures may indicate credential compromise, system misconfiguration, or attack attempts. Investigate authentication logs and implement appropriate security measures including password resets and account lockouts.

Data access anomalies could suggest unauthorized access attempts or system compromise. Review access logs and implement additional monitoring and access controls as needed.

Payment processing irregularities may indicate fraud attempts or system compromise. Immediately investigate payment anomalies and coordinate with payment gateway providers for fraud prevention.

System intrusion indicators require immediate response including system isolation, forensic analysis, and security control reinforcement. Follow established incident response procedures and coordinate with security teams.

### User Support and Issue Resolution

User support procedures ensure customer issues are resolved quickly and effectively while maintaining high levels of customer satisfaction. Proper support procedures turn potential negative experiences into positive customer interactions.

Account access issues often involve forgotten passwords, email verification problems, or device compatibility issues. Provide clear self-service options and escalation procedures for complex cases.

Payment processing problems may result from declined cards, network issues, or configuration problems. Implement clear error messages and alternative payment options to minimize transaction failures.

App functionality issues could indicate bugs, device compatibility problems, or user confusion. Provide comprehensive help documentation and responsive customer support channels.

Feature requests and enhancement suggestions provide valuable input for product development priorities. Implement feedback collection and analysis procedures to identify common requests and improvement opportunities.
